This project is the final project for a Bachelor Degree in Informatics Engineering, coursed in the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya. It is about the development of a computer system capable of comparing two audio files, where one person talks, and determine if these sequences share speakers, with an optimal error rate of 29,77%; and a graphics interface that uses it.
